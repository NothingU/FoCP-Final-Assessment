BPP Pizza Price Calculator
This simple Python program calculates the total price for a pizza order at Beckett Pizza Plaza (BPP) based on various factors such as the number of pizzas, delivery requirements, whether it's Tuesday, and if the customer used the BPP App.

Instructions
Run the program by executing python bpp_pizza_calculator.py in the terminal.

Enter the required information when prompted:

How many pizzas ordered?
Is delivery required? (Y/N)
Is it Tuesday? (Y/N)
Did the customer use the app? (Y/N)
The program will then calculate and display the total price based on the provided information.

Pricing Rules
Every pizza from BPP costs £12.
A 50% discount applies to all pizza prices on Tuesdays (excluding delivery cost).
Delivery costs £2.50, unless there are five or more pizzas, in which case it is free.
A 25% discount is applied if the customer orders via the BPP App. This discount is applied after the Tuesday discount.
Error Handling
If an invalid number of pizzas is entered, the program will prompt for a valid input.
The program ensures valid inputs for delivery, Tuesday, and app usage with error messages for incorrect entries.
Feel free to use and modify the code to suit your needs. Enjoy your pizza ordering experience with BPP!
